Route Planner

YOUR ROVER equivalent:
    Your rover has no route planning — it just goes forward and avoids obstacles.

THIS VERSION:
    Uses CARLA's road network to plan a route from A to B.
    Outputs a list of waypoints the vehicle should follow.
    The controller steers toward the next waypoint.
